## Overview
Synthetic data provides a powerful alternative to real-world datasets by generating artificial, high-quality, and privacy-preserving data.  
It enables innovation in AI, research, and product development without the constraints of data scarcity, cost, or privacy regulations.

## Use Cases
- **AI Training & Prototyping** â€“ generate scalable datasets for machine learning models.  
- **Healthcare Research** â€“ access synthetic patient data (EMRs, clinical records) without breaching confidentiality.  
- **Finance & Business** â€“ build and test predictive models with synthetic tabular and time-series data.  
- **Computer Vision & GenAI** â€“ train models on synthetic images, 3D vision datasets, and multimodal inputs.  
- **Testing & Simulation** â€“ safely test applications in edge cases and rare-event scenarios.
